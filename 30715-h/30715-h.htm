<h1><span class="sp1">WHERE THERE'S HOPE</span></h1>

<h2>By Jerome Bixby</h2>

<p class="hd1"><small>Illustrated by Kelly Freas</small></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"If you</span> called me here to tell
me to have a child," Mary
Pornsen said, "you can just forget
about it. We girls have made up
our minds."</p>

<p>Hugh Farrel, Chief Medical
Officer of the Exodus VII, sighed
and leaned back in his chair. He
looked at Mary's husband. "And
you, Ralph," he said. "How do you
feel?"</p>

<p>Ralph Pornsen looked at Mary
uncomfortably, started to speak
and then hesitated.</p>

<p>Hugh Farrel sighed again and
closed his eyes. It was that way
with all the boys. The wives had
the whip hand. If the husbands put
up an argument, they'd simply get
turned down flat: no sex at all,
children or otherwise. The threat,
Farrel thought wryly, made the
boys softer than watered putty. His
own wife, Alice, was one of the
ringleaders of the "no babies"
movement, and since he had openly
declared warfare on the idea, she
wouldn't even let him kiss her
good-night. (For fear of losing her
determination, Farrel liked to
think.)</p>

<p>He opened his eyes again to look
past the Pornsens, out of the curving
port of his office-lab in the Exodus
VII's flank, at the scene outside
the ship.</p>

<p>At the edge of the clearing he
could see Danny Stern and his
crew, tiny beneath the cavernous
sunbeam-shot overhang of giant
leaves. Danny was standing up at
the controls of the 'dozer, waving
his arms. His crew was struggling
to get a log set so he could shove
it into place with the 'dozer. They
were repairing a break in the barricade&mdash;the
place where one of New
Earth's giant saurians had come
stamping and whistling through
last night to kill three colonists before
it could be blasted out of existence.</p>

<p>It was difficult. Damned difficult.
A brand-new world here, all ready
to receive the refugees from dying
Earth. Or rather, all ready to be
<i>made</i> ready, which was the task
ahead of the Exodus VII's personnel.</p>

<p>An Earth-like world. Green,
warm, fertile&mdash;and crawling, leaping,
hooting and snarling with ferocious
beasts of every variety. Farrel
could certainly see the women's
point in banding together and refusing
to produce children. Something
inside a woman keeps her
from wanting to bring life into
peril&mdash;at least, when the peril
seems temporary, and security is
both remembered and anticipated.</p>

<p>Pornsen said, "I guess I feel just
about like Mary does. I&mdash;I don't
see any reason for having a kid until
we get this place ironed out and
safe to live in."</p>

<p>"That's going to take time,
Ralph." Farrel clasped his hands in
front of him and delivered the
speech he had delivered so often in
the past few weeks. "Ten or twelve
years before we really get set up
here. We've got to build from the
ground up, you know. We'll have
to find and mine our metals. Build
our machines to build shops to
build more machines. There'll be
resources that we <i>won't</i> find, and
we'll have to learn what this planet
has to offer in their stead. Colonizing
New Earth isn't simply a matter
of landing and throwing together
a shining city. I only wish it
were.</p>

<p>"Six weeks ago we landed. We
haven't yet dared to venture more
than a mile from this spot. We've
cut down trees and built the barricade
and our houses. After protecting
ourselves we have to eat. We've
planted gardens. We've produced
test-tube calves and piglets. The
calves are doing fine, but the piglets
are dying one by one. We've
got to find out why.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a long, long
time before we have even a minimum
of security, much less luxury.
Longer than you think.... So
much longer that waiting until the
security arrives before having children
is out of the question. There
are critters out there&mdash;" he nodded
toward the port and the busy clearing
beyond&mdash;"that we haven't
been able to kill. We've thrown everything
we have at them, and
they come back for more. We'll
have to find out what <i>will</i> kill them&mdash;how
they differ from those we
<i>are</i> able to kill. We are six hundred
people and a spaceship, Ralph. We
have techniques. That's <i>all</i>. Everything
else we've got to dig up out
of this planet. We'll need people,
Mary; we'll need the children.
We're counting on them. They're
vital to the plans we've made."</p>

<p>Mary Pornsen said, "Damn the
plans. I won't have one. Not now.
You've just done a nice job of describing
all my reasons. And all the
other girls feel the same way."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">She looked</span> out the window
at the 'dozer and crew. Danny
Stern was still waving his arms; the
log was almost in place. "George
and May Wright were killed last
night. So was Farelli. If George
and May had had a child, the monster
would have trampled it too&mdash;it
went right through their cabin
like cardboard. It isn't fair to bring
a baby into&mdash;"</p>

<p>Farrel said, "Fair, Mary? Maybe
it isn't fair <i>not</i> to have one. <i>Not</i> to
bring it into being and give it a
chance. Life's always a gamble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>It</i> doesn't exist," Mary said.
She smiled. "Don't try circumlocution
on me, Doc. I'm not religious.
I don't believe that spermatozoa
and an ovum, if not allowed to
cuddle up together, add up to murder."</p>

<p>"That isn't what I meant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You were getting around to it&mdash;which
means you've run out of
good arguments."</p>

<p>"No. I've a few left." Farrel
looked at the two stubborn faces:
Mary's, pleasant and pretty, but set
as steel; Ralph's, uncomfortable,
thoughtful, but mirroring his definite
willingness to follow his wife's
lead.</p>

<p>Farrel cleared his throat. "You
know how important it is that this
colony be established? You know
that, don't you? In twenty years or
so the ships will start arriving.
Hundreds of them. Because we
sent a message back to Earth saying
we'd found a habitable planet.
Thousands of people from Earth,
coming here to the new world
we're supposed to get busy and
carve out for them. We were selected
for that task&mdash;first of judging
the right planet, then of working
it over. Engineers, chemists,
agronomists, all of us&mdash;we're the
task force. We've got to do the job.
We've got to test, plant, breed, re-balance,
create. There'll be a lot of
trial and error. We've got to work
out a way of life, so the thousands
who will follow can be introduced
safely and painlessly into the&mdash;well,
into the organism. And we'll
need new blood for the jobs ahead.
We'll need young people&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mary said, "A few years one way
or the other won't matter much,
Doc. Five or six years from now
this place will be a lot safer. Then
we women will start producing. But
not now."</p>

<p>"It won't work that way," Farrel
said. "We're none of us kids any
longer. I'm fifty-five. Ralph, you're
forty-three. I realize that I must be
getting old to think of you as
young. Mary, you're thirty-seven.
We took a long time getting here.
Fourteen years. We left an Earth
that's dying of radioactive poisoning,
and we all got a mild dose of
that. The radiation we absorbed in
space, little as it was, didn't help
any. And that sun up there&mdash;" again
he nodded at the port&mdash;"isn't
any help either. Periodically
it throws off some pretty damned
funny stuff.</p>

<p>"Frankly, we're worried. We
don't know whether or not we <i>can</i>
have children. Or <i>normal</i> children.
We've got to find out. If our genes
have been bollixed up, we've got
to find out why and how and get
to work on it immediately. It may
be unpleasant. It may be heart-breaking.
But those who will come
here in twenty years will have absorbed
much more of Earth's radioactivity
than we did, and an
equal amount of the space stuff,
and this sun will be waiting for
them.... We'll have to know what
we can do for them."</p>

<p>"I'm not a walking laboratory,
Doc," Mary said.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you are, Mary. All
of you are."</p>

<p>Mary set her lips and stared out
the port.</p>

<p>"It's got to be done, Mary."</p>

<p>She didn't answer.</p>

<p>"It's going to be done."</p>

<p>"Choose someone else," she said.</p>

<p>"That's what they all say."</p>

<p>She said, "I guess this is one
thing you doctors and psychologists
didn't figure on, Doc."</p>

<p>"Not at first," Farrel said. "But
we've given it some thought."</p>

<p>MacGuire had installed the button
convenient to Farrel's right
hand, just below the level of the
desk-top. Farrel pressed it. Ralph
and Mary Pornsen slumped in
their chairs. The door opened, and
Doctor John J. MacGuire and Ted
Harris, the Exodus VII's chief psychologist,
came in.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">When it</span> was over, and the after-play
had been allowed to
run its course, Farrel told the
Pornsens to go into the next room
and shower. They came back soon,
looking refreshed. Farrel ordered
them to get back into their clothes.
Under the power of the hypnotic
drug which their chairs had injected
into them at the touch of
the button, they did so. Then he
told them to sit down in the chairs
again.</p>

<p>MacGuire and Harris had gathered
up their equipment, piling it
on top of the operating table.</p>

<p>MacGuire smiled. "I'll bet that's
the best-monitored, most hygienic
sex act ever committed. I think
I've about got the space radiations
effect licked."</p>

<p>Farrel nodded. "If anything goes
wrong, it certainly won't be our
fault. But let's face it&mdash;the chances
are a thousand to one that something
<i>will</i> go wrong. We'll just
have to wait. And work." He
looked at the Pornsens. "They're
very much in love, aren't they?
And she was receptive to the suggestion&mdash;beneath
it all, she was
burning to have a child, just like
the others."</p>

<p>MacGuire wheeled out the operating
table, with its load of serums,
pressure-hypos and jury-rigged
thingamabobs which he was testing
on alternate couples. Ted Harris
stopped at the door a moment. He
said, "I think the suggestions I
planted will turn the trick when
they find out she's pregnant.
They'll come through okay&mdash;won't
even be too angry."</p>

<p>Farrel sighed. They'd been over
it in detail several times, of course,
but apparently Harris needed the
reassurance as much as he did. He
said: "Sure. Now scram so I can
go back into my act."</p>

<p>Harris closed the door. Farrel
sat down at his desk and studied
the pair before him. They looked
back contentedly, holding hands,
their eyes dull.</p>

<p>Farrel said, "How do you feel?"</p>

<p>Ralph Pornsen said, "I feel fine."</p>

<p>Mary Pornsen said, "Oh, I feel
<i>wonderful</i>!"</p>

<p>Deliberately Farrel pressed another
button below his desk-top.</p>

<p>The dull eyes cleared instantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you've given it some
thought, Doc?" Mary said sweetly.
"And what have you decided?"</p>

<p>"You'll see," Farrel said. "Eventually."</p>

<p>He rose. "That's all for now,
kids. I'd like to see you again in
one month&mdash;for a routine check-up."</p>

<p>Mary nodded and got up. "You'll
still have to wait, Doc. Why not
admit you're licked?"</p>

<p>Ralph got up too, and looked
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Wow," he said. "I'm tired."</p>

<p>"Perhaps just coming here," Farrel
said, "discharged some of the
tension you've been carrying
around."</p>

<p>The Pornsens left.</p>

<p>Farrel brought out some papers
from his desk and studied them.
Then, from the file drawer, he selected
the record of Hugh and
Alice Farrel. Alice would be at the
perfect time of her menstrual cycle
tomorrow....</p>

<p>Farrel flipped his communicator.</p>

<p>"MacGuire," he said. "Tomorrow
it's me."</p>

<p>MacGuire chuckled. Farrel could
have kicked him. He put his chin
in his hands and stared out the
port. Danny Stern had the log in
place in the barricade. The bulldozer
was moving on to a new task.
His momentary doubt stilled, Farrel
went back to work.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Twenty-one</span> years later, when
the ships from Earth began arriving,
the log had been replaced
by a stone monument erected to
the memory of the Exodus VII,
which had been cut apart for its
valuable steel. Around the monument
was a park, and on three
sides of the park was a shining
town&mdash;not really large enough to
be called a city&mdash;of plastic and
stone, for New Earth had no iron
ore, only zinc and a little copper.
This was often cause for regret.</p>

<p>Still it was a pretty good world.
The monster problem had been
licked by high-voltage cannon. Now
in their third generation since the
landing, the monsters kept their
distance. And things grew&mdash;things
good to eat.</p>

<p>And even without steel, the
graceful, smoothly-functioning
town looked impressive&mdash;quite a
thing to have been built by a handful
of beings with two arms and
two legs each.</p>

<p>It hadn't been, entirely. But nobody
thought much about that any
more. Even the newcomers got
used to it. Things change.</p>
